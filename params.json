Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\r\n\r\nSometimes you want numbered lists:\r\n\r\n1. One\r\n2. Two\r\n3. Three\r\n\r\nSometimes you want bullet points:\r\n\r\n* Start a line with a star\r\n* Profit!\r\n\r\nAlternatively,\r\n\r\n- Dashes work just as well\r\n- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:\r\n    * Like this\r\n    * And this\r\n\r\n*This text will be italic*\r\n_This will also be italic_\r\n\r\n**This text will be bold**\r\n__This will also be bold__\r\n\r\n_You **can** combine them_\r\n\r\n\r\nUnordered\r\n\r\n* Item 1\r\n* Item 2\r\n  * Item 2a\r\n  * Item 2b\r\nOrdered\r\n\r\n1. Item 1\r\n2. Item 2\r\n3. Item 3\r\n     * Item 3a\r\n     * Item 3b\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:\r\n\r\n> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.\r\n> - Captain Janeway\r\n\r\nAs squirrel said:\r\n\r\n> 年轻啥子都不用担心\r\n> 这就是资本.\r\n\r\n![Image of squirrel](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:\r\n\r\n    if (isAwesome){\r\n      return true\r\n    }\r\n\r\nGitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (isAwesome){\r\n  return true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif (isAwesome){\r\n  return true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:\r\n\r\n- [x] This is a complete item\r\n- [ ] This is an incomplete item\r\n\r\nWhen you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!\r\n\r\nAnd, of course emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nsummary(cars)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\r\n\r\n```{r }\r\nplot(cars)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
